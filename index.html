    <h2>About Me</h2> 
    <p class="gap">
        I'm an IT professional and a passionate cybersecurity enthusiast, dedicated to expanding my knowledge across all areas of technology. I began my IT career in 2018, majoring in computer networking at Wentworth Institute of Technology, where I discovered my love for information security.
    </p>
    <p class="gap">
        In 2021, while vacationing in Khartoum, Sudan, I gained hands-on experience volunteering in an organization where my uncle was working as a network engineer. Although the organization’s security setup was minimal, I proactively sought ways to enhance it. I conducted extensive research on Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)—a field I find particularly compelling—and leveraged my strength in documentation to implement improvements. I reviewed and adapted relevant frameworks and guidelines to address critical security gaps, ultimately contributing to a stronger security posture for the organization.

    <h2>Work Experience</h2> 
    <p class="gap">
        After my time in Sudan, I worked for Allied Universal, a security compnay that was contracted with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company in Cambridge, Massachusetts, as a serivce desk and SOC Analyst (though not in cybersecurity, but in physical security). In this role, I:
    </p>
    <ul class="gap">
        <li>Monitored surveillance systems and alarms: Detected unauthorized access and potential security risks, contributing to physical security compliance.</li> 
        <li>Managed access control systems: Assigned permissions based on defined roles to minimize security vulnerabilities and ensure alignment with access control policies.</li>
        <li>Investigated alarm activations: Coordinated with security teams to address and mitigate security threats, maintaining compliance with safety protocols.</li>
    </ul>


    <p class="gap">
        Although I gained valuable skills, especially in customer service, from my role in physical security, I was eager to transition into IT. I began applying primarily for help desk roles to gain hands-on IT experience. Fortunately, I was hired as an IT Analyst by Dav El Boston Coach in Everett, Massachusetts. In this role, I gained a broad range of technical skills, supporting various IT functions, including desktop support, system administration, and security improvements. Key responsibilities and accomplishments included:
    </p>
   

    <ul class="gap">
        <li>Managed Active Directory user accounts, permissions, group policies, host security, file permissions, and file system integrity, ensuring adherence to the principle of least privilege.</li>
        <li>Monitored and analyzed security alerts and logs using AlienVault SIEM and SentinelOne EDR/IDS, identifying and responding to potential security incidents, and reducing risks across the organization.</li>
        <li>Configured and deployed SentinelOne EDR across devices to protect endpoints from malware and cyber threats, reinforcing endpoint security.</li>
        <li>Conducted phishing security assessments using KnowBe4, educating users on security best practices, and reducing social engineering risks.</li>
        <li>Collaborated with senior system administrators to manage and maintain the company's infrastructure while providing help desk support to over 250 users.</li> 
        <li>Created, decommissioned, and managed Windows and Linux servers using VMware ESXi and VCenter, ensuring smooth server operations in a cloud environment.</li>
        <li>Performed patch management and system updates, applying security fixes and ensuring systems were hardened and compliant with industry standards for data integrity and availability.</li>
        <li>Administered Microsoft Office 365 and Exchange servers, handling user onboarding/offboarding processes, provisioning services, and managing user access to critical systems.</li>
    </ul>
